# Text-mining-PDFs-in-R
This R code pipeline was collaboratively developed with contributions from friends and leveraged open source resources.

This script orchestrates a comprehensive text mining pipeline for analyzing PDF documents. It encompasses multiple stages, including word extraction, frequency analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling. The script iterates through each PDF file, extracts text data, cleans it, computes word frequencies, generates histograms, applies Zipf's law analysis, performs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and constructs networks of relevant bigrams. It also computes keyword statistics for further insights.
